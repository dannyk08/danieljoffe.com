  challenge: [
    'I began my career at a wine subscription startup during a pivotal transformation period. ClubW was rebranding to Winc, and I found myself at the center of both technical and brand evolution challenges.',
    'Marketing was bottlenecked by engineering. Creating campaign landing pages required developer intervention for every single page, limiting the team to just 3 pages per week. Meanwhile, we were undergoing a complete brand transformation that demanded seamless user experience continuity.',
  ],
  solution:
    "I developed a custom, self-serve landing page CMS using Angular 2, which was a relatively cutting-edge technology at the time. This wasn't just a technical project; it was about empowering an entire team to move at the speed of business.",
  impact:
    'Marketing launched 200+ campaign pages within two months of the CMS launch. I also orchestrated the technical aspects of the ClubW to Winc rebrand, ensuring zero user friction during the transition while simultaneously leading our AngularJS to Angular 2 migration for improved framework stability.',
  learned:
    'The power of eliminating bottlenecks through smart tooling, and how technical solutions can directly accelerate business growth.',

  challenge: [
    "Moving to Internet Brands' Health vertical meant entering the complex world of healthcare applications, where technical excellence had to meet strict regulatory requirements.",
    'I was thrust into senior-level responsibilities despite my title, leading a team of 5 developers (3 junior, 2 mid-level) while ensuring HIPAA compliance across clinical office applications. The company also needed to fill a critical Senior Developer role that had been vacant.',
  ],
  solution:
    'I took ownership of both people and process. I drove HIPAA compliance research and implementation, led the hiring process for 30+ Junior, Mid-Level, and Senior Developer candidates, and built a shared React component library that unified our microservices UI.',
  impact:
    'We achieved full application launch within one month through streamlined development processes. I successfully hired the key Senior Developer we needed, refactored an unstable Angular 2+ application, and repaired our CI pipeline to ensure reliable deployments.',
  learned:
    "Leadership isn't about titles. It's about taking responsibility for outcomes. I discovered my ability to manage both technical architecture and team dynamics simultaneously.",

  solution:
    'I became a student of the domain, collaborating closely with QA teams, backend engineers, and library cataloging SMEs. I built 30+ features in AngularJS while focusing on scalability and accessibility.',
  impact:
    'I achieved full WCAG compliance by researching, diagnosing, and remediating accessibility violations across our legacy Spring application. My dynamic cataloging components increased both accuracy and flexibility for diverse asset types.',

  solution:
    'I led a comprehensive infrastructure optimization initiative, established development guidelines for the growing engineering team, and built tools that empowered other departments to work independently.',
  impact:
    "I reduced mobile website load times from 10 seconds to ~2 seconds, boosting Lighthouse mobile scores by 40+ points. I created an A/B testing component for Marketing and extended our UI component library with Storybook, ultimately reducing Content team's developer dependency by 90%.",
