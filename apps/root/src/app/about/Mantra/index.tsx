          <p>
            I&apos;m driven by the challenge of making complex systems simple
            and empowering teams to do their best work. As a natural
            collaborator, I thrive in cross-functional environments where I can
            translate between technical and business needs. My leadership style
            is rooted in mentorship. I believe in investing in people&apos;s
            growth because when teams succeed, products succeed.

            What&apos;s remained constant is my focus on removing bottlenecks,
            empowering teams, and driving measurable business impact through
            thoughtful technical solutions. Each experience built capabilities
            that informed the next, creating a career trajectory focused not
            just on technical growth, but on becoming the kind of engineer who
            makes everyone around them more effective.
